Provision and manage virtual machines from cloud providers

The DOC file has some explanations about the structure & features.


Installation:

Use Python3, e.g. in a virtual environment:
virtualenv -p python3 env
. env/bin/activate

pip install -r req.txt

Set up local_settings.py:
― Type a random string for the SECRET_KEY
― Choose the DB (the file has instructions for DBs that need additional setup)
cd vimmasite
cp local_settings.py.example local_settings.py
cd ..

During initial development don't use migrations. There's too much change and
experimentation. Instead, create the data model every time.
Remember to run this every time you make a change (or update your repository):
rm -f vimmasite/vimma/migrations/0*.py
./vimmasite/manage.py makemigrations


Run Tests:
rm -f vimmasite/vimma/migrations/0*.py
./vimmasite/manage.py makemigrations
./vimmasite/manage.py test vimma
