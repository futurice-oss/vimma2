Provision and manage virtual machines from cloud providers

Vimma is distributed under the BSD 3-clause license, see the file COPYING.

The DOC file has some explanations about the structure & features.

The scripts/ directory has scripts for common commands (e.g. creating a python
virtual environment, starting the task queue). They are only a convenience: you
may instead alter & run the commands yourself, e.g. with different arguments,
with a different (or no) virtual environment.


Installation:

Use Python3, e.g. in a virtual environment:
./scripts/venv-reset.py

Set up local_settings.py:
― Type a random string for the SECRET_KEY
― Choose the DB (the file has instructions for DBs that need additional setup)
cd vimmasite
cp local_settings.py.example local_settings.py
cd -

Set up AWS credentials for dev testing:
cd scripts/dev-data
cp secrets.py.template secrets.py
cd -

During initial development don't use migrations. Instead, delete & create them
every time (the helper scripts call scripts/migrations-reset.py).

./scripts/polymerjs-reset.py	# install PolymerJS


./scripts/test.py	# run tests


To run the project:

./scripts/db-reset.py	# reset DB and migrations, create dummy data
rabbitmq-server		# start rabbitmq
./scripts/worker.py	# start celery worker
./scripts/beat.py	# start celery beat (periodic task scheduler)
./scripts/webserver.py	# start the webserver
