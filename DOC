Create and manage VMs from a provider, such as Amazon Web Services.

A user belongs to a set of Projects. VMs are assigned to projects not users.

Some actions require permissions. A Role is a set of permissions. A user
has a set of Roles.
There is a special permission, OMNIPOTENT_PERMISSION, which grants a user all
permissions (without having to assign each permission explicitly).

A user U has permission P if there is a role R, assigned to U,
and R's permission set includes P or OMNIPOTENT_PERMISSION.
Otherwise user U doesn't have permission P.
