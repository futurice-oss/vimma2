Create and manage VMs from a provider, such as Amazon Web Services.

A user belongs to a set of Projects. VMs are assigned to projects not users.

Some actions require permissions. A Role is a set of permissions. A user
has a set of Roles.
There is a special permission, OMNIPOTENT_PERMISSION, which grants a user all
permissions (without having to assign each permission explicitly).

A user U has permission P if there is a role R, assigned to U,
and R's permission set includes P or OMNIPOTENT_PERMISSION.
Otherwise user U doesn't have permission P.

The OMNIPOTENT_PERMISSION also lets a user perform some actions for which we
don't define an explicit permission. E.g. normally users can only create VMs
in the projects they're part of. To avoid permission explosion, we don't define
permissions for each case we want to allow, e.g.
create_vm_without_prj_membership, but instead allow superusers to perform these
actions.
